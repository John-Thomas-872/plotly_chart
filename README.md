# Plotly Chart

The focus of this project is to access data from a sample.json file and create a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge that help explain the data that is given. Once the charts are created, the is all displayed on a webpage using html to create a dashboard. The dashboard also allows the user to filter between the different test subjects and the charts and graphs will update with each new subject that is selected. Finally, the data is displayed in github using github pages.
